# Branch Protection Configuration

This document describes the recommended branch protection rules for the repository.

## Push Validation (All Branches)

**NEW**: All pushes to any branch now require validation!

The `push-validation.yml` workflow automatically runs on every push to any branch:
- ✅ Builds backend (.NET)
- ✅ Runs all backend tests
- ✅ Builds frontend (React)
- ✅ Runs all frontend tests
- ❌ **Blocks the push if any validation fails**

This ensures that even direct pushes (not through PRs) maintain code quality.

## Main Branch Protection Rules

### Required Status Checks
Configure these status checks to be required before merging:

- ✅ **Quick Build & Test Validation** (Push Validation) - Must pass
- ✅ **Backend Build & Test** (PR Validation) - Must pass
- ✅ **Frontend Build & Test** (PR Validation) - Must pass
- ✅ **Code Quality Checks** (PR Validation) - Must pass
- ✅ **PR Validation Summary** - Must pass

### Branch Protection Settings

Go to: **Settings → Branches → Add rule** for `main` branch

#### Protect matching branches
- [x] Require a pull request before merging
  - [x] Require approvals: **1**
  - [x] Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
  - [x] Require review from Code Owners

- [x] Require status checks to pass before merging
  - [x] Require branches to be up to date before merging
  - Required status checks:
    - `Quick Build & Test Validation` (from Push Validation workflow)
    - `Backend Build & Test` (from PR Validation workflow)
    - `Frontend Build & Test` (from PR Validation workflow)
    - `Code Quality Checks` (from PR Validation workflow)
    - `PR Validation Summary`

- [x] Require conversation resolution before merging

- [x] Require signed commits (optional but recommended)

- [x] Require linear history (optional)

- [x] Include administrators (apply rules to admins too)

- [x] Restrict who can push to matching branches
  - Only allow: Repository administrators

- [x] Allow force pushes: **Never**

- [x] Allow deletions: **Never**

## Develop Branch Protection (if applicable)

Same rules as main, but with:
- Require approvals: **1** (can be less strict)
- Allow force pushes: **Specify who** (only to maintainers, optional)

## Feature Branch Naming Convention

Use these prefixes for feature branches:
- `feature/` - New features
- `bugfix/` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/` - Urgent fixes for production
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `test/` - Test improvements
- `ci/` - CI/CD improvements

Example: `feature/add-job-health-score`

## Automated Merge Requirements

The PR validation workflow ensures:
1. All backend tests pass (Domain, Application, API, Architecture)
2. All frontend tests pass (Unit, Integration, Architecture)
3. Code quality checks pass (formatting, security)
4. No build errors in either backend or frontend
5. Code coverage meets minimum thresholds (if configured)

## Manual Steps After PR Approval

After all checks pass and PR is approved:

1. **Squash and Merge** (recommended) - Creates a clean history
2. **Merge Commit** - Preserves all commit history
3. **Rebase and Merge** - Linear history without merge commits

Choose based on your team's preference.

## Emergency Procedures

In case of critical production issues:

1. Create a `hotfix/` branch from `main`
2. Make minimal changes to fix the issue
3. Create PR with `[HOTFIX]` prefix in title
4. Fast-track review process
5. All automated checks must still pass
6. After merge to main, backport to develop if needed

## Monitoring

Monitor the following regularly:
- Failed PR checks in GitHub Actions
- Code coverage trends
- Security scan results
- Dependabot alerts
